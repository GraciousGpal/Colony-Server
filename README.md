## Project Info
Colony is an old multiplayer flash game, its source code was lost long ago, and the server shut down.

With the assistance of the lovely fan community of the game and permission from the author,the back-end server was reversed engineered for them to play with each other again.
The project involved working with ActionScript3, XML, and Python.

Development involves inspecting decompiled code of the client and listening to network packets sent by the client (See [Packet Inspector](tools/packet_inspector.py)).
